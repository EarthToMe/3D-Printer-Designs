These replace the all metal idler mounts on a RatRig Vcore 3.1 printer with enclosure 2.0 (open front). They relocate the belt tensioning so you can use other toolheads! Each sliding mechanism allows for ~10mm of tensioning once engaged with the screw.

They are designed to be made from aluminum, but I also plan to make printed/heat set insert versions as well.

The rear hole on the slider should be tapped for M5 thread, and the holes on the top and bottom plates should be tapped for M2.5 thread.

It uses the same parts for each side. On each side, the 3mm spacer goes on the top.
